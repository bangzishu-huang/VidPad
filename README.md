# VidPad
A macropad created for more efficient video viewing. There are 6 keys which are lit with LEDs, a rotary encoder for volume control, an OLED screen, and a XIAO RP2040 (microcontroller). 

This roughly took me around 18+ hours because it was my first time designing any type of hardware, but I really enjoyed the process!

# PCB
Everything was done on KiCAD, and I used a JLCPCB plugin for exporting the gerber files.

# Case
The case was made in AutoDesk Inventor due to my prior knowledge in the software. The PCB is held together through a sandwich mount.
